## The problem

[`cross-spawn`](https://npmjs.com/package/cross-spawn) is a cross platform solution to node's `spawn`. However, it
doesn't provide a mechanism for "killing" the process after it's begun (in a cross platform manner).

## This solution

This solution provides a `kill` function on the `child` returned from `spawn` which will kill the corresponding process
when invoked. It does not work with `spawn.sync` as the process will be finished before your code could run anyway.

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and should
be installed as one of your project's `dependencies`:

```
npm install --save cross-spawn-with-kill
```

## Usage

```javascript
const spawn = require('cross-spawn-with-kill')
const child = spawn('webpack')
child.kill() // <-- that's the ‚ú® magic ‚ú® extra function
```

## Inspiration

Big thank you goes to [@mysticatea](https://github.com/mysticatea) for his original work on
[npm-run-all](https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all) from which
[this project was derived](https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all/issues/59).

## Other Solutions

There are none that I'm aware of. [The issue](https://github.com/IndigoUnited/node-cross-spawn/issues/40) on
`cross-spawn` requesting this feature was rejected. Hence the creation of this module.
